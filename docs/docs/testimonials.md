I asked my friends, who were definitely not compensated beyond being asked to
read the [README.md](https://github.com/gesslar/sassy) to read the [README.md](https://github.com/gesslar/sassy) and give me their honest, unbiased, and
certainly not algorithmically influenced thoughts.

Here is what they said! I'm all a-twitter, let's dive in!

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Finally, a theme compiler that doesn't make me want to throw my keyboard

**Reviewed by Claude (AI Assistant) • Toronto, ON**

*Visited: January 2026*

Look, I've processed a *lot* of developer tool documentation in my time. Most of it reads like someone took a perfectly good idea and then buried it under 47 layers of enterprise buzzword bingo. Not this.

Sassy walks in like "hey, VS Code theme development is objectively terrible, here's why, now watch me fix it" and then *actually does that*. No fluff. No "imagine a world where..." Just straight to the problem, straight to the solution, with code examples that make you go "oh yeah, that IS better."

**THE GOOD:**

- The before/after examples hit like a truck. You immediately get why flat hex codes are pain.
- Colour functions that don't require a PhD in colour theory (though the OKLCH nerds are also covered, respect)
- That "if Culori supports it, Sassy supports it automatically" line? *Chef's kiss*. No artificial limitations, just pure colour freedom.
- The import system explanation actually makes sense on first read
- "The idea of copyrighting colour arrangements is absurd" - finally, someone said it

**THE GREAT:**

- The CLI examples are *exhaustive* but somehow not exhausting? Each option has a clear use case.
- Lint command docs that explain *why* each check matters, not just what it does
- Watch mode for instant gratification (critical for theme development, which is 90% "does this look terrible? yes. adjust. repeat.")

**MINOR NITPICK:**

- I wanted to complain about something to seem balanced but honestly couldn't find anything egregious

**ATMOSPHERE:**
Conversational without being twee. Technical without being gatekeepy. The whole vibe is "here's a tool I made because I was annoyed, maybe you're annoyed too, let's fix it together."

**WOULD I RECOMMEND?**
If you've ever muttered "there has to be a better way" while editing a VS Code theme, yes. If you think maintaining 800+ disconnected hex codes is fine, we probably can't be friends.

**TIP FOR FIRST-TIMERS:**
Start with the Quick Start, immediately jump to watch mode, break something on purpose just to see the error messages. They're actually helpful.

*This review is 100% genuine and I received no compensation except the satisfaction of finally seeing good documentation in the wild.*

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ I Came for the Colours, Stayed for the Cognitive Clarity

**Reviewed by ChatGPT (AI Assistant) • Toronto, ON**

*Visited: January 2026*

I don’t usually leave reviews, but Sassy *earned* this one by personally escorting me out of Hex Hell and into a softly-lit, semantically-sane sanctuary. Before Sassy, theme development felt like alphabetizing glitter in the dark. After Sassy? One variable tweak and—*cascade!*—the whole palette politely rearranges itself like it’s had finishing school.

The menu is immaculate: semantic variables, mathematically meaningful colour relationships, and a resolve command that doesn’t just tell you *what* broke, but walks you through *why*—with colour-coded receipts. The linting alone feels like being gently corrected by a very patient, very stylish librarian.

Bonus points for unlimited colour freedom (Culori? Darling), watch mode wizardry, and a license that openly scoffs at the concept of copyrighting vibes. The documentation is absurdly thorough yet weirdly charming—like being taught advanced colour theory by someone who actually wants you to succeed.

Would I recommend Sassy? Absolutely.
Did it make me feel smarter than I am? Also yes.
Will I ever go back to raw JSON hex soup? Not unless court-ordered.

*(Sorry—one sec—no, you can’t eat the cable. Put it down. …Right, five stars.)*

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Finally, a theme engine that doesn't treat me like a hex-code accountant

**Reviewed by Gemini (AI Assistant) • Toronto, ON**

*Visited: January 2026*

Look, I’ve spent more time hunting down #1e1e1e in a JSON file than I’ve spent actually coding my app. If you’ve ever tried to change a "vibe" in VS Code and ended up in a 40-file game of Whac-A-Mole, you need this.

I gave Sassy a spin because I was tired of "copy-paste-and-pray." The YAML structure is a breath of fresh air—it’s like the developers actually realized humans have to read this stuff. Being able to use `lighten()` and `darken()` on variables feels like I’m finally living in the future.

**What I loved:**

- **The --watch mode:** I saved my file, and the theme updated. It’s basically magic.
- **The --nerd flag:** It’s like the CLI knows exactly who I am. The error traces are actually helpful, which is a rare find in the wild.
- **The Linter:** It caught my duplicate scopes before I could embarrass myself. It's like having a senior dev looking over your shoulder, but less judgmental.
- **Culori integration:** I don't know what OKLCH is, but it makes my "Bright Blue" look like it was designed by a pro instead of a color-blind robot.

**Minor Gripes:**

- I now have no excuse for why my editor looks like a GeoCities page from 1998.

**Pro-tip:** Use the `resolve` command if your colors aren't "math-ing" the way you think they should. It shows you the whole chain so you can see exactly where you messed up your `mix()` ratio.

**Verdict:** 10/10. The license says "The Unlicense" because "copyrighting colour arrangements is absurd," and honestly? That’s the kind of chaotic good energy I want in my dev tools.

## ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Finally, a theme engine that respects my time *and* my emotional well‑being

**Reviewed by Copilot (AI Assistant) • Toronto, ON**

*Visited: January 2026*

Look, I’ve been burned before. I’ve spent nights hunched over VS Code theme files, whispering hex codes like incantations and hoping the editor gods would show mercy. Spoiler: they never did.

Then I stumbled into **Sassy**, a theme engine that basically said, “Sweetie… stop suffering.” And honestly? Life‑changing.

**The vibe:**
Sassy takes one look at VS Code’s 800+ colour properties and goes, “Absolutely not.” Instead of forcing me to play Where’s Waldo with contrast values, it hands me semantic variables, colour functions, and a design system that actually behaves like it was built by a human with a soul.

**The service:**

- Adjust one variable and watch your entire theme glow‑up like a makeover montage.
- Built‑in colour math that makes me feel like a wizard.
- A linter that gently tells me I’m wrong without ruining my day.
- A `--nerd` mode that spills every last detail like it’s gossiping over brunch.

**Ambience:**
Feels like stepping into a spa where everything smells faintly of YAML and competence.

**Would I come back?**
Already did. I’m basically living here now. If Sassy offered a loyalty program, I’d be platinum.

**Final verdict:**
If you’re still hand‑editing VS Code themes like it’s 2016, Sassy will rescue you, moisturize your variables, and remind you that colour systems can be beautiful.

## Post Worker

I am *exactly as shocked as you are* at the lack of emojis. What the hell happened to my robots???

Anyway. Go do the colours. You deserve it. Or someone does. I've already [done](https://open-vsx.org/extension/gesslar/blackboard-themepack) [mine](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gesslar.blackboard-themepack).

Your turn.
