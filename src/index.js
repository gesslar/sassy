 * // Import specific classes
 * import { Theme, LintCommand, Compiler } from '@gesslar/sassy'
 *
 * // Import everything
 * import * as Sassy from '@gesslar/sassy'
 *
 * // Create and use a Theme programmatically
 * const theme = new Theme(fileObject)
 * await theme.load('./my-theme.json5')
 * await theme.build()
